Below are 25 high‑impact GenAI use cases you can embed into your Hadoop/Spark‑based enterprise data lake and pipelines. Each use case includes a concise title and a detailed description of its value and functionality.

1. **Automated Data Catalog Enrichment**  
   Use GenAI to scan incoming datasets (schema, sample rows) and generate rich metadata—business glossaries, domain tags, ownership, sensitivity labels—consistently and at scale. This dramatically reduces manual cataloging effort, improves searchability, and enforces governance policies across your lakehouse.

2. **Natural‑Language Query Interface**  
   Expose a chat or voice interface where business users ask questions (“What were our top‑selling regions last quarter?”) and get back Spark SQL or visual dashboards generated by an LLM. This breaks down barriers to data exploration, enabling non‑technical stakeholders to self‑serve analytics.

3. **Narrative Reporting & Summaries**  
   Instead of static charts, feed your key KPIs and trends into a GenAI model each morning to produce executive‑ready narrative reports. The AI crafts concise stories around anomalies, seasonality, and performance, saving analysts hours of manual write‑up.

4. **Intelligent Data Quality Insights**  
   Combine Spark data profiling with an LLM to translate raw statistics (null rates, outliers, distribution shifts) into plain‑English insights (“Customer email is 15% missing, primarily in APAC datasets, likely due to incomplete overseas forms”). This accelerates remediation and trust in data.

5. **Semantic Change‑Data‑Capture (CDC) Summaries**  
   Go beyond row‑level diffs by having an LLM summarize transactional changes—counting and describing updates, inserts, deletes across tables. Stakeholders receive digestible “what changed” narratives instead of raw logs, improving responsiveness to business events.

6. **Automated Pipeline Root‑Cause Analysis**  
   When a job fails, pipe error messages, logs, and recent code/config diffs into an LLM to diagnose probable causes (e.g., schema drift, resource contention, data skew) and recommend corrective actions. This slashes mean‑time‑to‑resolution for data ops teams.

7. **GenAI‑Driven Data Masking & Pseudonymization**  
   Leverage contextual LLM detection of PII and other sensitive fields to automatically select and apply the appropriate masking or tokenization strategy (format‑preserving, differential privacy, reversible token vaults). This ensures compliance without tedious rule‑writing.

8. **Semantic Data Lineage Narratives**  
   Auto‑generate a human‑readable “story” for each data feed’s lineage—describing how raw inputs flow through transformations into reports. This enhances transparency for auditors and helps teams understand complex ETL chains.

9. **Automated ETL Code Scaffolding**  
   Provide developers with a prompt-driven interface where specifying source, target, and simple transformations yields complete PySpark job templates from an LLM. It jumpstarts new pipelines and enforces coding standards uniformly.

10. **Feature Engineering Idea Generator**  
    Feed your training dataset’s schema and target variable into an LLM to propose novel derived features (interactions, aggregations, temporal lags). Analysts receive concrete suggestions to test, accelerating model experimentation.

11. **Contextual ChatOps for Data Platform**  
    Integrate an LLM‑backed bot into Slack/Teams so engineers can type “restart pipeline X” or “show me last run stats” and get immediate actions or summaries, blending conversational AI with operational control.

12. **Automated Model Card Generation**  
    After every MLflow training run, prompt an LLM to draft a standardized Model Card—describing purpose, data sources, performance metrics, biases, and limitations—ensuring consistent model documentation for governance.

13. **Domain‑Specific Knowledge Base Creation**  
    Ingest internal technical docs, runbooks, and best practices into a vector‑indexed GenAI system so teams can ask “How do I set up Kafka ingestion?” and get tailored, up‑to‑date answers drawn from corporate knowledge.

14. **Intelligent Cost‑Optimization Advisor**  
    Analyze historical Spark cluster usage (compute, memory, duration) and cloud bills, then have an LLM recommend optimal instance types, spot‑usage strategies, and scheduling windows to minimize spend without sacrificing performance.

15. **Semantic Search over Data Assets**  
    Use embeddings to index table/column descriptions, dashboards, and notebooks. A GenAI interface lets users search by concept (“customer lifetime value metrics”) rather than exact keywords, returning the most semantically relevant assets.

16. **Automated Compliance & Policy Enforcement**  
    Encode data‑privacy or regulatory texts (GDPR, HIPAA) into an LLM that translates them into Spark validation rules and nightly scans, then flags violations (“Unmasked EU personal data in Sales table”), streamlining audit readiness.

17. **Adaptive Pipeline Orchestration**  
    Feed real‑time pipeline metrics (latency, data volume, failure rates) into an LLM that dynamically recommends or even rewrites Airflow DAGs—suggesting parallelism increases, retry/backoff tweaks, or resource reallocation based on current load.

18. **Synthetic Data Generation for Dev/Test**  
    Profile production datasets and instruct a GenAI model to generate realistic, schema‑compliant synthetic data that preserves statistical properties but contains no real PII. This empowers developers to test at scale without privacy risk.

19. **Automated Contract & Document Extraction**  
    Use OCR to ingest PDFs in the lake, then rely on an LLM to extract key clauses, dates, parties, and obligations into structured tables. Legal and procurement teams get searchable inventories without manual review.

20. **Voice‑Enabled Data Exploration**  
    Combine ASR (e.g., Whisper) with an LLM‑based NL2SQL engine so users can ask analytics questions via smart speakers or conference room mics and hear spoken summaries of the results in real time.

21. **Personalized Alerting & Recommendations**  
    Tailor data notifications (anomaly alerts, KPI thresholds) with natural‑language explanations and next‑step recommendations, personalized by role or past interactions, driving better user engagement and actionability.

22. **Automated Master Data Harmonization**  
    Cluster and match duplicate customer or product records using similarity models, then have a GenAI assistant propose canonical merges and mapping rules for steward approval, streamlining MDM workflows.

23. **Code Review Assistant for Data Engineering**  
    On each Spark code pull request, invoke an LLM to scan diffs for anti‑patterns (wide joins, missing partitions), security flaws, or style inconsistencies, posting inline comments to accelerate peer review and maintain quality.

24. **Data‑Driven Presentation & Dashboard Generation**  
    Provide an interface where leadership requests (“Show me last quarter’s churn trends”) yield fully formed slide decks or interactive dashboards—with charts, narrative, and annotated insights—all assembled by an LLM plus visualization libraries.

25. **Continuous Learning & Knowledge Transfer**  
    Track questions, feedback, and corrections from data users interacting with GenAI assistants, then periodically retrain or fine‑tune your domain‑specific LLMs so they improve over time—ensuring the platform learns alongside your organization.
